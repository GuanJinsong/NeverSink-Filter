Hey guys,

The 8.0 filter is ready and introduces a huge number of improvements. The filter is now generated using a small custom programming language (Exo) built by me. This makes the filter much more maintainable and enables a significantly more elegant structure.

Sadly, to get everything done for 3.14 (despite investing hundreds of hours), I had to cut corners. Namely: styles are currently not available (except CustomSounds) and will be remade in the future!

On the bright side: the new structure allows for MUCH better looking styles and there are also some new styles incoming, but when being confronted with a time issue, I wanted to focus on the core first.

I'll also be releasing new styles. The plan is to publish one new style and one old (reworked) style in ~2-3 weeks and then continue doing so every 1-2 months.

I apologize for the lack o' styles for this release!
